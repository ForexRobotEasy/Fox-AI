## Product Description

Fox AI Forex Software is a reliable and efficient trading system designed for night trading. It utilizes machine learning and intelligent algorithms to analyze market conditions and execute trades during specific time periods.

The code provided in this repository serves as a sample implementation of the Fox AI Forex Software. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only showcasing the sample code that can work as described in the product. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Usage

### Import Libraries

The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as `Kras.mqh` and `Tens.mqh`. These libraries contain functions and classes required for the trading system.

### Define Constants

Next, several constants are defined:

- `NIGHT_TRADING_START_HOUR` and `NIGHT_TRADING_END_HOUR` define the start and end hours of the night trading period.
- `ROLLOVER_PERIOD` specifies the number of times to execute trades during the rollover period.
- `CLOSE_TRADE_TIME_LIMIT` sets the time limit for closing trades.

### Expert Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the expert initialization function. It checks if the current time is within the night trading hours. If it is, the function performs deep learning analysis using `Kras.DeepLearningAnalysis()`. It then executes trades during the rollover period by calling the `ExecuteRolloverTrades()` function. Lastly, it closes trades within 12 hours by calling the `CloseTradesWithinTimeLimit()` function.

### Expert Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart. This function performs necessary cleanup tasks.

### Execute Rollover Trades

The `ExecuteRolloverTrades()` function is responsible for executing trades during the rollover period. This function should be implemented with the necessary trading functions to optimize trading strategies during this time.

### Close Trades Within Time Limit

The `CloseTradesWithinTimeLimit()` function is used to close trades within the specified time limit. It calculates the time limit for closing trades based on the current time and closes trades until the time limit is reached. This function should be implemented with the necessary trading functions to close trades.

### Clean Up Tasks

The `CleanUp()` function is responsible for performing necessary cleanup tasks. This function should be implemented with any required tasks for cleaning up resources or data.
